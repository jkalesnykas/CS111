**Overview**

The Polish mathematician Wacław Sierpiński described the Sierpinski pattern in 1915, but it has appeared in Italian art since the 13th century. This assignment accomplishes a recursively drawn Sierpinski pattern.

**Prerequisites**

The individual running this simulation must supply the program with *n*, which is the order: 1 filled triangle for n = 1; 4 filled triangles for n = 2, etc.

StdIn, StdOut, StdDraw are all assumed to be installed.

**Assignment Goal**

The main task is to write a multitude of methods that collaborate in the recursive function sierpinski(), which plots a Sierpinski triangle of order *n* to standard drawing.
