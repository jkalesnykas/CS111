**Overview**

The Polish mathematician Wacław Sierpiński described the Sierpinski pattern in 1915, but it has appeared in Italian art since the 13th century. This pattern is a fractal with a shape of an equilateral triangle. It is subdivided recursively into smaller equilateral triangles. This triangle is a basic example of self-similar sets in mathetmatics.

**Prerequisites**

The individual running this simulation must supply the program with *n* when executing, where *n* is the order of the drawn triangles: 1 filled triangle for *n* = 1; 4 filled triangles for *n* = 2, etc.

StdIn, StdOut, StdDraw are all assumed to be installed.

**Assignment Goal**

This assignment accomplishes a recursively drawn Sierpinski pattern. The main task is to write a multitude of methods that collaborate in the recursive function sierpinski(), which plots a Sierpinski triangle of order *n* to standard drawing.
